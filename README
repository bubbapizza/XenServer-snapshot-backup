This is an autoconf package for a script that does xva backups of a 
list of VMs for xenserver.  It will preserve the last few backups and
automatically delete old ones.  The destination for the xva files and number 
of xva files to retain are specified in a config file.

The script is meant to be run every so often via a cronjob and was 
originally based on a script written by Mark Round and Luis Davim.  

This package is a standard autoconf package which means you extract the
tarball and install it by running:

   ./configure
   make
   make install

After a default installation, here are some quick and dirty instructions 
for getting backups up and running:

1) cd to the config directory /usr/local/etc/xenserver-backup

2) Edit the default.conf file and set the IP address of a xenserver host 
   in your cluster

2) Edit the xe.pwf file and put the xenserver host's username on line 1
   and password on line 2.

3) Edit the vm-backup-list file and add the names of the VMs to 
   backup, one VM per line.  The name must match whatever the
   "name-label" attribute is of the VM.
  
4) schedule the job using the sample crontab entry in default.crontab

By default, xva backup files will be saved to /usr/local/var/lib/backup 
and it will retain the last 4 xva files.
