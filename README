This is an attempt at packaging the xenserver backup script by 
Mark Round and Luis Davim.  

The idea is to make an autotools package that you can just download and 
install on a linux VM that can act as a backup appliance.  It will control 
snapshot-based backups to either another storage repository or to xva 
files for DR sites.
