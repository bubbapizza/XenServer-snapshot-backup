This is an attempt at packaging the xenserver backup script by 
Mark Round and Luis Davim.  

The idea is to make an autotools package that you can just download and 
install on a linux VM that can act as a backup appliance.  It will control 
snapshot-based backups to either another storage repository or to xva 
files for DR sites.

As for how the backup script works, from Luis' blog:

You can configure the scheduling and retention for each VM, from the 
XenCenter, by adding the following custom fields:

    backup - to set the schedule for the template backups 
             (daily, monthly or weekly)
    retain - to set the number of backup templates to keep
    xva_backup - to set the schedule for the xva backups 
                 (daily, monthly or weekly)
    xva_retain - to set the number of xva files to keep
